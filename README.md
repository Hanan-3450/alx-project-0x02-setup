# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

This repository is part of the ALX SoloForge: Mastering Project Autonomy project.  
It demonstrates how to set up a modern Next.js application with TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS.  
The goal is to learn and apply best practices for project structure, reusable components, routing,  
API integration, and responsive UI design.
